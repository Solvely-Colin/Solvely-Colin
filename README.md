# Hey, I'm Colin 👋

Founder of **[Solvely](https://solvely.net)** — a HubSpot partner studio building tools that make CRM less painful. Sr Manager of CRM at Youth Enrichment Brands by day. Indiana-based, remote-first.

I like shipping things that solve real problems. Not a fan of overengineered solutions or AI slop.

## 🔨 What I'm building

### [Radius](https://solvely.net/apps/radius) — Geographic segmentation for HubSpot
Draw a radius on a map, get a segmented contact list. Built for franchise brands, multi-location businesses, and field sales teams who need location-aware CRM without the complexity.

`TypeScript` · `HubSpot SDK` · `Supabase` · `React`

> Currently in waitlist — [join here](https://solvely.net/apps/radius)

### [Quorum](https://github.com/Solvely-Colin/Quorum) — Multi-AI deliberation framework
Multiple AI models debate, critique, and vote on your question. Not a router — a deliberation engine. 7-phase pipeline: gather → plan → formulate → debate → adjust → rebuttal → vote.

`TypeScript` · `CLI` · `npm: quorum-ai` · ⭐ 5 stars

```bash
npx quorum-ai ask "Should we use microservices or a monolith?"
```

### [askquorum.ai](https://askquorum.ai) — Hosted Quorum (coming soon)
The web version. Run deliberations in your browser without touching a terminal.
