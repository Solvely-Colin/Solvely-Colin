# Hey, I'm Colin

Founder of **[Solvely](https://solvely.net)** — a HubSpot partner that builds apps and integrations. I run CRM at **Youth Enrichment Brands** as a Sr Manager and build the tools I wish existed through Solvely.

## What I'm working on

**[Radius](https://solvely.net/apps/radius)** — Geographic contact segmentation for HubSpot. Draw a circle on a map, get a contact list. Currently in waitlist.

**[Quorum](https://github.com/Solvely-Colin/Quorum)** — Open source multi-AI deliberation framework. Multiple models debate your question, critique each other, and vote. CLI and npm package.

```bash
npx quorum-ai ask "Should we use microservices or a monolith?"
```

**[askquorum.ai](https://askquorum.ai)** — Hosted version of Quorum. Sign up and run deliberations from the browser.
