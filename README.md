# Hey, I'm Colin 👋

Founder of [Solvely](https://solvely.net) — a HubSpot partner building tools that make CRM less painful.

## What I'm building

- **[Radius](https://solvely.net/apps/radius)** — Geographic contact segmentation for HubSpot. Draw a radius, get a list. Launching soon.
- **[Quorum](https://github.com/Solvely-Colin/Quorum)** — Multi-AI deliberation framework. Multiple models debate, critique, and vote on your question. Open source.

## Background

Sr Manager of CRM at Youth Enrichment Brands by day. Building Solvely nights and weekends. Indiana-based, remote-first.

I like shipping things that solve real problems. Not a fan of overengineered solutions or AI slop.
